# Ajax

Ajax stands for **Asynchronous JavaScript**

**XMLHttpRequest** (XHL for short) is a method we used to send and retrieve data.

If you want to get data back from a server, you need to send something to the server first.

We call this data we send to the server a **request**.

We call the stuff the server sends back a **response**

The action (sending a request and getting a response) is called a **fetch**
